# People Counter Script

This is a very simple phython script to harvest data from our peoplecounter gate counters (https://axper.com/en/resources/counting-technology/) 
and move it into our libinsight account (https://www.springshare.com/libinsight) which is what we use to analyze and prepare reports.  
Both these systems have APIs that can be used to move data back and forth.

Requires a separate authentication file with credentials for the respective APIs.

The script is scheduled to run every week (via cron) and by default, gathers and migrates data representing traffic in the past week.

the script can be invoked form the command line with explicit dates nd locations.  This is useful if there's an issue and we need to load a specific time period.  Syntax:

./request.py YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD locationID(optional)

The third option is the location ID of a specific location-this will limit retrieval to data matching the specified dates from that specific location.  Locations and their codes are:

5 = "Mary Idema Pew Library"
6 = Steelcase
7 = Frey Learning Center
14 = Siedman


It will pull all data from the peoplecounters from the first specified date to the second.  If no date arguments are specified, it will pull data from the last seven days.`

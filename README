PeopleCounterScript
===================


Very simple script to harvest data from our peoplecounter gate counters and put it into our libinsight account

Requires a separate authentication file with credentials for the respective APIs.

Can be invoked form the command line:

./request.py YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD

It will pull all data from the peoplecounters from the first specified date to the second.  If no date arguments are specified, it will pull data from the last seven days.`

PeopleCounterScript
===================


Very simple script to harvest data from our peoplecounter gate counters and put it into our libinsight account

Requires a separate authentication file with credentials for the respective APIs.

Can be invoked form the command line:

./request.py YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD locationID(optional)

The third option is the location ID of a specific location-this will limit retrieval to data matching the specified dates from that specific location.  Locations and their codes are:

5 = "Mary Idema Pew Library"
6 = Steelcase
7 = Frey Learning Center
14 = Siedman


It will pull all data from the peoplecounters from the first specified date to the second.  If no date arguments are specified, it will pull data from the last seven days.`
